### Structure of the live coding and tips to be prepared

- You will be provided with the live coding repository a few days ahead of the live coding meeting. Install dependencies and ensure it work beforehand. The challenge will be provided on the live coding meet.
- You will be doing the live coding call along with one or two potential teammates in a pair-programming or mob-programming fashion (depending on whether we are one or two people along with you). You will be the main driver, and we will support you in whatever way we can. This means that **_we will be doing our best to make you feel as comfortable as we can_**, providing help, advice, or whatever you need. Our goal is to evaluate your fit into the team, so we will do our best to help you shine your best version, simulating a common team situation with potential teammates.
- We value simple solutions with simple code above all. Try to avoid rabbit holes as much as you can, and if you feel that you are falling into one, it's perfectly fine to stop going that way and try to go simpler. We really value this kind of pragmatic attitude. Having said that, we know that this kind of interview can be stressful, so if we feel that you can go a simpler way because you're stuck or for any other reason, we will try to advise you.
- We do not seek a complete solution. We aim to focus on the system design and the implementation rather than a complete solution. So do not rush and focus on finding the best implementation possible.
- Some implementation details:
  - The code will be in TypeScript. If you're not familiar with it, we suggest you take a quick look at the basics. We do not demand guru-level skills, but a basic level to get going. We can cover gaps if you need help.
  - The framework will be **[React](https://react.dev/)** as provided in this repository
  - The testing framework will be **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**
  - For styling, we suggest you use **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. It's not mandatory, but it's a good way to speed up the process.
- Some other tips. For obvious reasons, they're not mandatory, just a few suggestions to have your mind and body as fresh as possible (all of the suggestions are proven to improve the freshness of body and mind).
  - Sleep well the day before. This will help you make better decisions.
  - If you are used to doing sports/workout, we suggest you do your workout before or the day before. This is proven to lower stress levels and improve focus.
  - Eat well before or the day before, as healthy as you can with no alcohol, no soft drinks, and with minimal ultra-processed food. This is proven to enhance concentration, energy levels, mood, and sleep quality, thereby boosting mental performance.
